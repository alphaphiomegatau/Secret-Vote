# Secret Vote

This is a a damn simple secret voting site. The admin has one password that is hardcoded (for now) and can open and close polls. The users can vote one time. This is enforced using PHP sessions, so they could get around the one vote by using different devices or opening and using and closing incognito.

This came out of my Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega needing an easy secret voting system.
